# PinkTaichi
An in memory NoSQL Document Store Written in Go aiming to have the performance of Redis and the friendliness and flexibility of Mongo.
It differs from TieDot in that it is in Memory and has a superior Query API. Please note that it is not Production ready and may have a few kinks.

For the usage if you already know Mongo read the Python Client Code and things will become self explanatory.
